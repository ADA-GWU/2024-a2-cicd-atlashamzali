<h1>Setting Up and Testing the Project</h1>

<p>To begin with, ensure a smooth setup of the project and perform comprehensive testing, follow the steps outlined below:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong>
    <p>Access the GitHub repository by navigating to the following link: <a href="https://github.com/ADA-GWU/2024-a2-cicd-atlashamzali">ADA-GWU/2024-a2-cicd-atlashamzali</a>.<br>
    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or any preferred version control tool.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Open the Project in Your Code Editor:</strong>
    <p>Once the repository is cloned successfully, navigate to the directory containing the project.<br>
    Open your preferred code editor and import the project.<br>
    Locate the file <code>src\main\java\ada\edu\demo\webtest\JpademoApplication.java</code> within the project structure.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Run the Project:</strong>
    <p>Inside your code editor, navigate to the mentioned Java file.<br>
    Click the button located on the bottom right corner of the code editor to initiate the project.<br>
    Check the terminal/console output for any errors or warnings to ensure the project is running smoothly.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Access the Web Page:</strong>
    <p>Open your Firefox web browser.<br>

    Verify that the page loads correctly without any errors.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Testing:</strong>
    <p>Return to your code editor.<br>
    Explore the testing section to examine all the available test cases for the project.<br>
    Ensure all test cases are appropriately designed and implemented to cover the desired functionalities.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Execute Test Cases:</strong>
    <p>Click on the "Run Test" button adjacent to the webtest section to execute all the test cases.<br>
    Monitor the test execution process for any failures or errors.</p>
